      <h2>Forward</h2>
      <p>A mountain is made of many individual layers of earth, each built on top of the last.</p>
      <p>The layer all others rest on is called the <strong>statum</strong>, and the tallest mountains have the strongest strata.</p>
      <p>Software knowledge is similarly built; High-level concepts are derived from atomic pieces, or layers.</p>
      <p><strong>Strengthen your stratum.</strong></p>

      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>If you find yourself wondering "am I doing this right?" then you are on the right track toward mastery of the topic at hand.</p>
      <p>What you realize you are lacking is the most effective learning tool; <strong>directly relevant advice from experts</strong>.</p>
      <p>CodeStratum aims to provide that advice at the moment you need it most, when you are building your foundational base.</p>
      <p>As a learner:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Push yourself to master fundamentals while also actualizing your goals</li>
        <li>Access expert advice that you may not otherwise have access to</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As an expert:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create deeply engaging learning experiences in a variety of domains</li>
        <li>Strengthen your education skills in a new way</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>No work has been done on this project yet, it is still very much in its infancy. Some ideas I have in no order or regard for complexity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub PR reviews seems like a good feature for providing the actual feedback</li>
        <li>Recognize that many early learners will not use PRs on their projects, have a commit workflow in mind</li>
        <li>If it's commits that are reviewed, of course it's up to the learner seeking expert advice to have an acceptable git discipline</li>
        <li>The ratio between learner and expert will always be skewed of course</li>
      </ul>
