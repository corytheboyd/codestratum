      <h2>Forward</h2>
      <p>The stratum is the bottom most layer in a stack based structure; everything else is built off of it.</p>
      <p>The mental model of learned software skills is the same, the stratum being a mastery of the atoms in the
        domain. When picking up a new domain, however, the path to mastery of the stratum is friction laden.</p>

      <h2>Learning In Isolation</h2>
      <p>You have diligently educated yourself on the topic, exhausting the hand-holding tutorials building contrived
        examples, but now it's time to actualize your own vision and you don't know where to start.</p>
      <p>The compiler, no matter how helpful, doesn't suggest using stdlib functions you don't know about that solve
        your exact problem. The community curated list of lint rules, similarly despite being of high quality, will not
        exhaustively strengthen your knowledge stratum.</p>

      <h2>A Better Path Forward</h2>
      <p>You need expert advice, from a human, but how do you get it? You work for a software company but there are no
        experts in this domain, or maybe you're just learning a new language for a side project, there are many
        situations we find ourselves in where expert advice is not easy to find.</p>
      <p><strong>CodeStratum</strong> will help you strengthen your stratum.</p>
