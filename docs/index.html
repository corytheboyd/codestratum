    <h2>Forward</h2>
    <p>The stratum is the bottom most layer in a stack based structure; everything else is built off of it.</p>
    <p>The mental model of learned software skills is the same, the stratum being a mastery of the atoms in the
      domain. When picking up a new domain, however, the path to mastery of the stratum is friction laden.</p>

    <h2>Learning In Isolation</h2>
    <p>You have diligently educated yourself on the topic, exhausting the hand-holding tutorials building contrived
      examples, but now it's time to actualize your own vision and you don't know where to start.</p>
    <p>The compiler, no matter how helpful, doesn't suggest using stdlib functions you don't know about that solve
      your exact problem. The community curated list of lint rules, similarly despite being of high quality, will not
      exhaustively strengthen your knowledge stratum.</p>

    <h2>A Better Path Forward</h2>
    <p>You need expert advice, from a human, but how do you get it? You work for a software company but there are no
      experts in this domain, or maybe you're just learning a new language for a side project, there are many
      situations we find ourselves in where expert advice is not easy to find.</p>
    <p>This is the bridge CodeStratum will help you cross.</p>

    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <h3>For learners</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit patches for review by the community of experts</li>
      <li>Recall expert advice as you strengthen your stratum</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For experts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Find learners seeking advice in your domain of expertise</li>
      <li>Provide guidance through GitHub comments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>As An Expert, Why?</h2>
    <p>If you're anything like me, you genuinely enjoy seeing others succeed, and even moreso feeling like you had an
      impact in making that happen. It's hard to find the time to sit down and help others though, as it can take quite
      a bit of your time to feel satisfied in your own guidance to a learner. This is made even harder when you already
      have a full time job, a full life of other things demanding your attention.</p>
    <p>I am not starting CodeStratum to profit from your expertise, I am starting CodeStratum to empower learners to
      sustainably pursue their goals and hopefully minimize giving up early, and really nothing else. If this aligns
      with your own goals, I am excited to work with you to strenthen our collective knowledge base, one learner at a
      time.</p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>I won't lie, none of this exists yet.</p>
    <p>Frankly, building out the MVP will be a fairly large chunk of work,
      something I would only like to commit to if there is a legitimate need for something like this. I am a firm
      believer in education, and will continue to pursue strengthening that skillset regardless of demand for a service
      like this. While I believe I can derive a suitable set of features for a service such as this one, I am also very
      open and receptive to ideas and feedback on CodeStratum itself.</p>
